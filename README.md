This project is a real-time, audio-reactive visualizer for the ESP32, developed to display dynamic visuals that respond to audio input.
The main logic for audio processing, beat detection, and graphics rendering is contained within CompositeVideo.ino.

The header files (with the exception of font8x8.h) are taken from [this repo](https://github.com/bitluni/ESP32CompositeVideo).
